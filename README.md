## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is a *two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game* built using Python for the terminal. It demonstrates how conditionals, loops, functions, and data structures work together to create a complete interactive program.

Players alternate placing their marks ("X" and "O") on a 3x3 board. The first player to align three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins. If the board fills without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

This project was submitted as part of the *final assignment* for CMPT 1011 and includes both the functional game and written answers demonstrating core Python concepts.

## 🧱 Key Features

- Turn-based gameplay for two users (Player X and Player O)
- Real-time board display updates in the console
- Input validation to prevent invalid or duplicate moves
- Win detection in all possible directions (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Option to play multiple rounds

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

- Use of *functions* to organize program logic
- Handling *user input* and *input validation*
- Applying *loops* and *conditional statements*
- Working with *lists* as a data structure for the game board
- Writing *reusable code* with clear naming conventions
- Understanding *mutable vs. immutable* types and their role in memory and behavior

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Language: *Python 3*  
- IDE: *IntelliJ IDEA / Any Python-compatible environment*  
- No external libraries needed

---

## 🕹 How to Play

1. Run the script in your Python environment (python project1.py)
2. Player X goes first; players take turns by entering a number from *1 to 9* representing the grid position:
3. The game continues until one player wins or the board is full.
4. After the game ends, players can choose to play again or exit.

## 📝 Reflections

This assignment helped strengthen our understanding of:
- Modular programming using functions
- The importance of planning logic flow before coding
- Python syntax, best practices, and debugging techniques

It was a great foundational exercise in building a small yet complete software system using just core programming constructs.
